# Capstone Project for IBM Data Science Certification

SpaceX can perform Falcon 9 rocket launches at a cost of around 62 million dollars, versus competitorsâ€™ costs of at least 165 million dollars for an equivalent launch
- SpaceX achieves this lower cost based on their ability to re-use the first stage of their Falcon 9 rocket

This project will create a machine learning pipeline to predict whether the first stage of the Falcon 9 will successfully land
- Based on this prediction, a company could more accurately estimate the cost of a launch
- SpaceX could use this information to tune their pricing process
- Competitors could use this information to help develop bids against SpaceX
